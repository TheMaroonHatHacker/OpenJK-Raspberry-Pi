# OpenJK-Raspberry-Pi
Builds OpenJK from source with one easy to run script.

This might work on a normal linux machine, but have yet to try it.

In the releases tab, there are also packages to download.

Before you run the binary, you'll need to install SDL

```sh
sudo apt install libsdl2-dev
```

Enjoy OpenJK on the Raspberry Pi!

# Note
This project isn't being worked on. Use at your own discretion (not that it matters, it's just the build instrucions from OpenJK that I've put into to bash script)
